Revision history for Perl extension Term-Size-Win32.

0.205  Sun May 21 2006
        - added t/00_use.t
        - added t/99_pod.t
        - Size.pm now lives in Term-Size distribution
          where it belongs

0.204  Sun May 20 2006
        - make test skips all tests if Win32::Console
          is not installed - this allows the distribution
          to be installed elsewhere, but it won't work
          if there is no working Win32::Console.

0.203  Fri May 19 2006
